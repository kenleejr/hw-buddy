## 🎯 Overview

HW Buddy creates a seamless learning environment where students can study naturally while receiving AI-powered guidance. The system uses computer vision to analyze homework in real-time and provides spoken feedback, keeping students focused on their work without context switching.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of three main components working together:

### 📱 Mobile App
- **Purpose**: Overhead camera positioned above student's workspace
- **Technology**: Flutter/Dart with Firebase integration
- **Functionality**: 
  - Takes high-quality photos of homework/study materials
  - Uploads images to Google Cloud Storage
  - Listens to Firestore for session commands

### 🖥️ Web App  
- **Purpose**: Student interface on laptop/tablet
- **Technology**: Next.js with Gemini Live API integration
- **Functionality**:
  - Voice-activated conversations with AI tutor
  - Real-time audio transcription and playback
  - Visual feedback and session management
  - Acts as intelligent transcriber passing requests to backend

### 🧠 Backend
- **Purpose**: AI reasoning engine and session orchestration
- **Technology**: Python FastAPI with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Functionality**:
  - Processes images with advanced AI vision models
  - Provides personalized homework guidance
  - Manages session state via Firestore
  - Delivers contextual, step-by-step assistance

### 🗄️ Data Layer
- **Firestore**: Session management and real-time coordination
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Secure image storage and retrieval

## 🚀 How It Works

### Setup Process
1. **Mobile Setup**: Position phone overhead as camera, launch app
2. **Session Creation**: Web app generates unique session ID with QR code
3. **Device Connection**: Mobile app scans QR code to link to session
4. **Study Session**: Start voice recording and natural conversation with AI tutor

### Learning Flow (Optimized)
1. **Student Speaks**: "Can you help me solve this math problem?"
2. **AI Decision**: Agent intelligently decides if visual context is needed
3. **Instant Image Capture**: Mobile app captures and uploads image directly (<50ms)
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Backend processes image with ADK agent using `Part.from_bytes()`
5. **Smart Response**: AI provides targeted guidance with visual understanding
6. **Audio Delivery**: Response delivered via WebSocket with live status updates

### Key Benefits
- **Ultra-Fast Processing**: Event-based architecture for <50ms image processing
- **Intelligent Decisions**: ADK agent only takes pictures when contextually relevant
- **Natural Interaction**: Voice-based communication with real-time feedback
- **Visual Understanding**: Direct image injection into AI context for accurate analysis
- **Seamless Experience**: No interruptions, continuous conversation flow

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.12+
- Flutter 3.0+
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled (no Storage needed)
- Google AI API key with Gemini access
- Mobile device with camera

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
```bash
# Create Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
# Enable Firestore Database (Cloud Storage no longer needed)
# Download configuration files for each platform
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
# Install uv package manager
pip install uv

# Sync dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Set up environment variables
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/firebase-service-account.json"

# Start the backend server
python main.py
```

### 3. Web App Setup  
```bash
cd web-app
npm install
# Add your Gemini API key to .env.local:
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key" > .env.local
npm run dev
```

### 4. Mobile App Setup
```bash
cd mobile-app

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Configure Firebase for Flutter (interactive setup)
flutterfire configure

# Add Firebase configuration files to appropriate directories:
# - android/app/google-services.json
# - ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

# For iOS deployment:
flutter build ios

# Open Xcode project
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select Runner project in navigator
# 2. Choose your development team
# 3. Connect your iOS device or use simulator
# 4. Click the Run button (▶️) to build and deploy

# For Android (alternative):
flutter run --release
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Position Mobile Device**: Mount phone overhead facing down at workspace
2. **Start Session**: Open mobile app, tap "Start Session", note the session ID
3. **Connect Web App**: Open web app, enter session ID, click "Join Session"  
4. **Begin Studying**: Click "Start Recording" and ask questions naturally
5. **Receive Guidance**: AI analyzes your work and provides spoken assistance

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env)**
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/firebase-key.json
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
